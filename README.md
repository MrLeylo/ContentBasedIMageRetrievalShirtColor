# ContentBasedIMageRetrievalShirtColor

## Requirements

* Python 3
* Pip 3 installed
* Run:
```
pip3 install -r rquirements.txt
```

## Preparations

* Download dataset from [this link](http://app.goldenspear.com/shirts.tar.gz)
* Uncompress it in the project root folder (at the same level than *deliverable_script.py*)
* Give permissions to all folders in the project

## Usage

* For reading the solution explanation while running the code run:
```
jupyter notebook
```
That will open a browser tab with the project files. Then open ContentBasedImageRetrievalShirtColor.ipynb and run the notebook

* For running the code and check the results without explanation run:
```
python3 deliverable.py
```

Both will create a folder with the name specified in the code in the *imgs_path_result* variable ('*resulting_blue*' by default, but if the folder exists and is not empty it adds a *_new* suffix on it)
